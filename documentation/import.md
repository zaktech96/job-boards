when calling a component in next js what i need to do depending on what i have set at the start is calling with @ before the component such import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
as shown above this is calling on an external library called clerk so when calling on libary it will do @
however when calling within the project the format of ./ which means go into folder by one level up
